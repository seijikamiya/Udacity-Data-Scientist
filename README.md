# Udacity-Data-Scientist
code for Udacity Data Scientist cource

## Installation
There should be seaborn libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.   
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*. At least Python 3.7.9 works.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2020 to better understand:

1. Which country do most people answer this survey?
2. What percentage of developers are satisfied with their job?
3. Which factors have influenced the job satisfaction?

## File Descriptions
All my project is written in First_Project.ipynb.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://10seiji18.medium.com/what-percentage-of-developers-are-satisfied-with-their-job-63dadc1619f6).

## Licensing
Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.
